 Euler's Identity
50
Easy

One night, a man named Euler gave you three strings in your dream: MD5:d8d540ae49aadd151b96feb4e0ff124f, SHA1:abb07ca45c9e7719e66e766b958d943f561b8de6, SHA2(SHA1(MD5)):c037c03ee627047a85df540c42d59c6b6028841704a7c706feff584a997fd2a3.

People ask:'How does great Euler find the relationship among pi, imaginary number, and Euler's number.'

On the following night, the man appeared in your dream again. He told you concatenating secrets together foreshadowed the future. For example, given MD5(This), SHA1(is), and SHA2(SHA1(MD5(future))), the key is flag{Thisisfuture}.
